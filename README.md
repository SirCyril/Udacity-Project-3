Loan Data Analysis and VIsualization

# Loan Dataset Exploration
By Cyril Odoi

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding approximately 114,000 loan applications by Borrowers in the United States over the period 2009 to 2014, includineg. BorrowerRate, ProsperScores, IncomeRange and DebtToIncomeRatio. 
The dataset can be found here: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547358770029000;
and with feature documentation available [here]: https://tinyurl.com/UdacityProject


## Summary of Findings

After analysing each variable, Borrowers's Rate, Borrowers's Prosper score, Monthly Income available  were found to be positively correlated to Borrower's Loan Amount received. Adding that, borrower' Scores (given from 0 to 11) gave a strong correlation with Loan Duration on loans.

Borrowers with different Prosper ratings were also analysed. It came out that borrowers with the low ratings received higher Borrower Rate percentage, and borrower with high rating received low Rate percentage. This is as a result of risk and likelihood of default on the loan.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the effects of Borrower location, Borrower Rate, Homeownership status and Monthly Income to determine the Loan Original Amount received. Prosper Scores was most pronounced on the amount received by Borrowers, the healthier the Prosper score, the higher the Borrower received in loan amount. The plots also showed that on average, amounts received were between $1000 and 20,000.
